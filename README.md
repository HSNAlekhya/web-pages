What is a webpage?

      A web page is a single, accessible digital document on the internet, part of a larger website, 
      containing text, images, videos, and links, viewable in a browser and built with HTML, CSS, 
      and JavaScript for structure, style, and interactivity. 
      Each page has a unique URL for direct access, offering static (fixed) or dynamic (changing) content, 
      serving as the primary way information is presented online, from simple blogs to complex applications. 
      
Key Characteristics

    Content: 
    
      Text, images, videos, audio, and interactive elements (forms, buttons). 
    
    Technology: 
    
      Primarily coded in HTML (structure), styled with CSS (design), and enhanced with JavaScript (behavior). 
    
    Accessibility:
    
      Accessed via a unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL) through a web browser (Chrome, Firefox). 
      
    Hyperlinks: 
    
      Contains clickable links (hyperlinks) to navigate to other pages or resources.

Types of Web Pages

    Static Pages: 
    
      Content remains the same for all users, built with HTML/CSS (e.g., simple about pages, landing pages). 
    
    Dynamic Pages: 
    
      Content changes based on user actions, time, or other factors, often using server-side languages and 
      databases (e.g., social media feeds, e-commerce sites). 
      
Web Page vs. Website

    A web page is a single document (like one page in a book). 
    
    A website is a collection of related web pages, all under a single domain name (like the entire book).
